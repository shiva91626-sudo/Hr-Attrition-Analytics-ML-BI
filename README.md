🧑‍💼 HR Attrition Analytics (ML + Power BI + Tableau)

End-to-end HR Attrition Prediction & Analytics project combining Machine Learning, Business Insights, and BI Dashboards to help leadership reduce employee turnover through data-driven decisions.

📌 Project Overview

Salifort Motors (fictional company) wanted to understand why employees leave and which employees are at risk of attrition.

This project:

Predicts employee attrition using ML models

Explains why employees leave (salary, satisfaction, department)

Translates predictions into actionable HR insights using dashboards

🎯 Business Objective

Predict whether an employee will leave or stay

Identify high-risk groups

Help HR teams take preventive retention actions

Avoid blanket policies → targeted interventions

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

Target Variable:

left (0 = Stay, 1 = Leave)

Models Used:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest ✅ (Final Model)

XGBoost

Class Imbalance Handling:

SMOTE applied on training data

Final Model Performance (Random Forest):

Accuracy: 98.3%

Precision: 98%

Recall: 92%

F1-Score: 95%

ROC-AUC: 97.7%

📊 Key Insights

Low salary employees have the highest attrition risk

Low satisfaction (< 0.4) sharply increases turnover probability

Sales, Technical, and Support departments show highest attrition

~80% of employees fall in very low-risk range

Model predictions closely match actual attrition patterns
